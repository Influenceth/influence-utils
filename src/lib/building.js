      products. Bioreactors feature transparent growing tunnels containing microgravity soil
      beds for agricultural plants brought from Earth, as well as water tubes built into the

    assemblies, the most specialized and complex type of products. These are typically used
    in the construction of ships and buildings. Shipyards additionally feature large
    mobile gantries which allow for the construction of ship hulls, and the final integration
    of modules onto those hulls to create ships. Those two types of work can be performed
    in parallel, unlike with other buildings. Shipyards are best operated by Engineers. `

    description: `The Spaceport allows for the docking of all ship classes on an asteroid's
      surface, not just those capable of performing all-terrain landings like
      the Light Transport. Spaceports are constructed as a large well leading to underground
      ship parking areas, and are therefore limited in space. The more ships they store,
      the slower docking and undocking becomes. Ships docked in a Spaceport can load and unload
      their cargoes and propellant, and can host Crews doing work.`

    description: `The Marketplace serves as the central point of the Adalian economy. Once
      they are built on an asteroid they allow for the exchange of all local
      raw materials, refined materials, crops, manufactured goods, and assemblies.
      Marketplaces feature large spinning rings which provide artificial gravity for traders
      who work there on a temporary basis, much like a conference center. They support both
      limit and market orders, for both buying and selling, and allow a limited number of
      products which may be traded, and which their owner can configure, along with fees.
      When trades are matched, those fees accrue to the owner. Marketplaces are best managed
      by Merchants.`

    description: `The Habitat is the city of Adalia. Habitats are constructed of large,
      well-appointed spinning rings to provide artificial gravity, and the inner edge of
      those rings is populated by many Habitation Modules, which are used for homes and public
      buildings. In addition to allowing the stationing of Crews, they are the only location
      which allows new Crewmates to be recruited, from the pool of work-ready young adults
      who grew up at that Habitat. Habitats do not have unlimited space, and once they are more
      than half full, the productivity boost which they grant to Crews stationed there begins
      to drop due to overcrowding, until it is completely gone at full capacity.`
